            <p>I am Himaja. I have completed my B.tech in Electronics. 
                As my uncle suggested me to apply for MSIT and I have written entrance test. I have qualified 
                in the exam and secured good rank. I got seat in IIITH.</p> 
                This course is also present on:
                <ul>
                    <li>JNTUH</li>
                    <li>JNTUK</li>

            <p>Before joining in MSIT I had a lot of fear that I was from Electronics
                background and if will be able to manage with IT or not. Fortunately, the cirriculum of 
                MSIT was too good that I was able to understnad each and every topic and developed my coding 
                skills quickly. 
            </p> 
            Till now I have learne the following courses:

                This all happened because of the faculty in the MSIT. They were always helpful for me
                when ever I was in need. The grading system is also good. The infrastucture is also too good.
                We sit in AC class rooms and 24x7 WI-FI facility.

                Coming to the hotel experience, the girls hostel is very good and we have LAN fecility in the 
                hostel rooms to work in the room also. The mess is also very good. We have 4 messes and depending
                on out taste we can go to the mess that we like. However, we need to register in the mess portal
                if we want to change the mess.
            </p>

            <p>
                We participate in many events such as alumini meets where we will get to the skills we need to
                develop. We participate in each and every IIIT event such as felicity. We had secret santa game
                as a part of chirsmas.
